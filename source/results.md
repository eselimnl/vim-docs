# 3.1. Select the module to run

There are five modules to select from: SEVANT, IDTA, ViTA, DiTA, CROSTA. The first four (4) modules can be run independently or as a pipleline by selecting them all. All of them use the same file input type (see: Acceptable file formats), MSA file format. CROSTA is run independently as it accepts two files instead of one and its interpretation and outputs differ from the other modules.
