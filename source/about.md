# 1.1. ViVA Integration Module (ViM)
ViM is the integrated module for VIral Variome Analyser (VIVA) that allows users to run SEVANT, IDTA, ViTA, DiTA, and CROSTA applications from one single interface. ViM also supports pipelined tasks as well where the applications (with exception for CROSTA) can run concurrently or one-after-another.

: **Figure 1.** It is a three-step process that begins with selection of the application/module to run. In the second step, a multiple alignment file or DiMA generated JSPN file is uploaded. Information about the viral taxonomy ID, the name of the viral protein being analysed and the isolation host is provided by the user. The last step is the revelation of the results.
